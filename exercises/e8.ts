/**
 * FUNCTIONS E8: Different types of function syntax
 * =====================================================================================
 * @task
 * Create three functions using 3 types of syntax: named, arrow and function expression (with anonymous function)
 * * Functions/Variables names:
 * * * Named function: getValueWithConditionOne
 * * * Arrow Function name: getValueWithConditionTwo;
 * * * Variable name for the function expression: getValueWithConditionThree;
 * * Every works as follows:
 * * * The function take an object as an argument
 * * * * The object contains two key-value pairs of type number both
 * * * If the numbers are both equal to 40, return the sum of them
 * * * Else return the doubled sum of them
 * * The function returns a boolean if array includes an item that is greater than val1 and less than val2
 * * The argument type must be annotated
 * * You can/should use Type Alias in this exercise
 * Example: getValueWithConditionOne({ num1: 40, num2: 40 }) => 80;
 * Example: getValueWithConditionOne({ num1: 20, num2: 30 }) => 100;
 * !!! ALL THREE functions must be exported !!!

// Your code goes here...

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-8"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
