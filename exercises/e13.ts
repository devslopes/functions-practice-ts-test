/**
 * FUNCTIONS E13: Additional practice
 * =====================================================================================
 * @task
 * Create a function that works as follows:
 * * The function name is 'getDiffTwentySeven' strictly.
 * * The function takes an argument of a number:
 * * The function returns:
 * * * If the argument is less than or equal to 27 => absolute difference of the given number and 27
 * * * If the arguments is greater than 27 => absolute doubled difference of the given number and 27
 * * Argument types must be annotated
 * * You can use any type of function syntax!
 * Example: getDiffTwentySeven(13) => 14
 * Example: getDiffTwentySeven(37) => 20
 * !!! The function must be exported !!!

// Your code goes here...

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-13"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
